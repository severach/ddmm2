Dual Display Mouse Manager

This is a C only rewrite of the original C++ MFC [Dual Display Mouse Manager](http://ddmm.sourceforge.net/) which didn't work for me with 3 screens. I redid everything in C, added some features, and fixed 3 screen support.

It should have an installer and a way to autostart as admin but I haven't built those yet. I just put an icon on my desktop.

It builds easily in [Pelles C](http://www.smorgasbordet.com/pellesc/).
